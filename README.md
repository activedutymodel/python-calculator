# Python Calculator
A beginner-friendly calculator that accepts two numbers from the user and performs basic mathematical operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Features
- Accepts both integers and decimal inputs
- Handles all four basic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`)
- Uses clean, formatted output with rounded results
- Prevents crashes on invalid input using `try` blocks (if added)
- Demonstrates string interpolation with f-strings

## Example Output
Welcome to the Python Calculator!
You will be asked to enter two numbers.

First number: 5

Second number: 3

Results:

5.0 + 3.0 = 8.0

5.0 - 3.0 = 2.0

5.0 * 3.0 = 15.0

5.0 / 3.0 = 1.67
